Reincarnation and Technology Final Project

If you'd like to play the game yourself, make sure you have Python installed on your computer and then get api keys for the Open AI api here:
https://openai.com/blog/openai-api

Once that's all set up, run 

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

then

```bash
python3 app.py
```

and the game will begin!

Watch me play a demo of the game here:
